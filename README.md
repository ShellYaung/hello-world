There are 2 projects posted, including Python codes for Titanic survival prediction and R codes for Airbnb analysis.
In the Titanic Project, I used logistic regression to predict the survival after some data cleaning and structuring. While in the Airbnb project, data visualization was used to identify the business problems and key variables, then different models are applied, including K-nearest, clustering, multiple linear regression, and classification tree. 
Please kindly take a look and leave a feedback if there any bugs and flaws.


Best,
